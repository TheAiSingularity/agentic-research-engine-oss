## DEC-007 — Wave 2: SOTA enhancement track + research paper
**Date:** 2026-04-20
**Context:** The research-assistant recipe works end-to-end locally and on cloud, but isn't SOTA. User wants to push to world-class on speed+accuracy+compute axes and publish. Reference target: MiroThinker-H1 at 88.2 BrowseComp (surpasses Gemini-3.1-Pro and Claude-4.6-Opus). User's rig: 4× RTX 6000 Pro Blackwell, fully self-hosted.
**Decision:** Ship Wave 2 enhancements in three tiers:
- **Tier 1 (quality at zero/negative compute cost):** `core/rag` v1 (BM25 + dense + RRF hybrid), cross-encoder reranker (lazy-loaded), contextual chunking helper, evidence dedup in `_search`, citation-grounding validation in scorer, SGLang alternative + EAGLE speculative decoding flags.
- **Tier 2 (adaptive compute for accuracy):** HyDE planner rewriting, Chain-of-Verification after synthesize, iterative retrieval (ITER-RETGEN), self-consistency gated on uncertainty. Lives in a future `production/` tier.
- **Tier 3 (infra + paper):** SimpleQA-100 + BrowseComp-Plus-50 harness, Pareto ablation plot, blog post + arXiv tech report.
**Rust:** keep main pipeline Python (vLLM/SGLang + HF tokenizers are already Rust under the hood). One dedicated Rust artifact — `recipes/by-pattern/rust-mcp-search-tool/` — showcasing 4 ms cold start, 5 MB binary as a case study.
**Benchmarks:** SimpleQA-100 + BrowseComp-Plus-50.
**Paper:** Blog post + arXiv TR (no conference deadline).
**Consequences:** Wave 1 ships the baseline; Wave 2 is where we compete with MiroThinker. Every technique leave-one-out ablated. `core/rag` v0 stays for reproducibility; v1 is the new default via `HybridRetriever`.



## DEC-001 — Format: runnable recipe gallery, not tutorial series
**Date:** 2026-04-19
**Context:** Initial framing was "tutorial series / handbook" explaining OpenClaw, OpenShell, Hermes Agent, NemoClaw, plus the broader ecosystem. Tested against real GitHub data: pure tutorial / link-list repos plateau at 300–1.3K stars. Runnable-recipe repos (`Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps`: 106K⭐ / 15% fork-to-star ratio) dominate interaction in this category.
**Decision:** Pivot to clone-and-run recipe gallery. Foundations (4 pages) and comparisons (6 pages) stay as SEO support — not the headline.
**Consequences:** Higher interaction ceiling. Every recipe must `make run` in ≤60s from a fresh clone or it doesn't ship. CI load grows with recipe count.

## DEC-002 — Three flagship recipes for Wave 1, not fifty
**Date:** 2026-04-19
**Context:** Original scope was 50+ recipes. User pushed back: ship 3 first, prove the format, then scale.
**Decision:** Wave 1 ships **three recipes**: research-assistant, youtube-analyzer, trading-copilot. Each shipped in **four framework implementations** (plus vanilla baseline) to showcase side-by-side comparison. Twelve runnable impls total.
**Consequences:** Faster to first real ship. Framework comparison becomes a Wave 1 deliverable rather than a nice-to-have. Recipe count grows iteratively.

## DEC-003 — Python + Rust, strategic not parallel
**Date:** 2026-04-19
**Context:** Original plan was Python + TypeScript. User clarified: Rust, not TS.
**Decision:** Python is universal across all recipes. Rust is clustered in categories where it genuinely wins: MCP servers, inference runtimes, tool binaries, edge agents, sandbox-escape research. Target ~50 Python recipes / ~10–15 Rust recipes over the full roadmap — not 1:1 parity.
**Consequences:** Differentiated positioning (no serious agent-recipe repo exists in Rust). Lower maintenance cost than naive parity. TypeScript is deliberately out of scope.

## DEC-004 — Single repo with core/ graduation path, not two repos
**Date:** 2026-04-19
**Context:** User asked whether RAG should be its own repo. Analysis: two repos up front = 2× setup, halved network effect, premature abstraction.
**Decision:** Shared `core/` library inside this repo (rag / memory / tools / sandbox). Recipes import from `core/` rather than duplicating. Graduate `core/rag/` into a standalone `TheAiSingularity/agentic-rag` repo when it hits traction criteria (≥1K stars on this repo, ≥20 recipes using it, stable API across 2 waves).
**Consequences:** Cross-promotion between recipes and core library. Cleaner API via real-usage pressure before spin-out. Later fork is a 2-hour job, not an architectural migration.

## DEC-006 — SOTA-per-task, not framework comparison
**Date:** 2026-04-19
**Context:** Wave 0 shipped with recipes advertising 4 framework implementations each for side-by-side comparison. User clarified the real goal: "SOTA cookbooks for respective tasks, not a comparison suite." The framework-comparison angle was my invention, not theirs. The correct model is OpenAI Cookbook / Anthropic Cookbook — one opinionated, state-of-the-art implementation per task.
**Decision:** Every recipe ships exactly **one** implementation — the SOTA stack for that task, chosen for cheapest-yet-most-accurate. Framework comparison suites are dropped from inside recipes. `comparisons/` keeps its role as standalone landscape pages (SEO-valuable). Every recipe adds `techniques.md` (citations for SOTA choices) and `eval/` (reproducible scorer against gold answers) so the SOTA claim is verifiable.
**SOTA stacks chosen (April 2026, benchmark-backed):**
- research-assistant: LangGraph + Exa + `core/rag/` (contextual + hybrid + rerank) + Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite (→ GPT-5.4 mini for hard reasoning). Expected cost: $0.01–$0.03/query.
- youtube-analyzer: Pydantic AI + yt-dlp (+ Groq Whisper fallback) + Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite (1M context). Expected cost: $0.001–$0.02/video.
- trading-copilot: LangGraph + yfinance + RSS + model routing (Flash-Lite analyst → GPT-5.4 mini skeptic). Expected cost: $0.005–$0.02/cycle.
**Consequences:** 12 empty framework subdirs deleted from Wave 0 scaffold. Per-recipe README, CONTRIBUTING, root README, recipes/README, and recipe-request issue template all rewritten. Tasks.yaml reset: T3/T4/T5/T6/T7/T8 now scope "SOTA impl + techniques.md + eval harness" per recipe instead of 4-framework port. Comparison pages still ship in Wave 2 — but in `comparisons/`, not inside recipes.

## DEC-005 — Name: agentic-ai-cookbook-lab
**Date:** 2026-04-19
**Context:** Iterated through multiple candidate names. User wanted descriptive, okay-with-collisions, lab vibe. Target form: "agentic AI recipe/cookbook + lab."
**Decision:** `TheAiSingularity/agentic-ai-cookbook-lab`. Zero star-weighted GitHub collisions, descriptive (every keyword earns its keep), matches user's phrasing.
**Consequences:** URL is 23 characters — long but clean. "Agentic" keyword pulls in high-intent 2026 search traffic. "Cookbook" signals the content format. "Lab" signals experimentation / comparison.
