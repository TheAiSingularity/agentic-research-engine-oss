**SOTA cookbooks for agent tasks — one opinionated, cheap-yet-accurate implementation per recipe.**

This is the OpenAI Cookbook / Anthropic Cookbook model, focused on agent tasks. Each recipe ships one state-of-the-art implementation — researched, benchmarked, and priced — not a menu of alternatives. The goal: the authoritative answer to "how do I build X in 2026."

Every recipe works end-to-end in under a minute from a fresh clone. Every choice (framework, retrieval stack, LLM, data source) is justified in that recipe's `techniques.md` with primary-source citations. Every recipe has an `eval/` harness so the accuracy claim is reproducible.

The default sandboxed runtime for production-tier recipes is [HermesClaw](https://github.com/TheAiSingularity/hermesclaw) — Hermes Agent inside NVIDIA OpenShell, kernel-enforced.

## The three flagship recipes (Wave 1)

| Recipe | What it does | SOTA stack | Cost per run |
|---|---|---|---|
| [research-assistant](recipes/by-use-case/research-assistant/) | Answers research questions with web search + RAG + synthesis, fully cited | LangGraph · Exa · `core/rag/` (contextual + hybrid + rerank) · Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite | $0.01–$0.03 |
| [youtube-analyzer](recipes/by-use-case/youtube-analyzer/) | Transcript → chapters → summary → titles, with typed schemas | Pydantic AI · yt-dlp (+ Groq Whisper fallback) · Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite (1M context) | $0.001–$0.02 |
| [trading-copilot](recipes/by-use-case/trading-copilot/) | Market research + alerts (NOT auto-execution) | LangGraph · yfinance + RSS · Flash-Lite → GPT-5.4 mini routing for skeptic critique | $0.005–$0.02 |

## Repo layout

```
recipes/       # SOTA recipes, organized by use-case and by pattern
core/          # Shared primitives: rag · memory · tools · sandbox
foundations/   # Plain-English explainers: OpenClaw · OpenShell · NemoClaw · Hermes Agent
comparisons/   # Landscape pages (framework/protocol/sandbox landscape)
skills/        # Reusable agent skills
```

## Levels

Every recipe declares its available levels:

- **`beginner/`** — ≤100 lines, heavily commented, `make run` in ≤60 seconds. **Every recipe has this.**
- **`production/`** — real tests, observability, HermesClaw compose, SLO/cost numbers. **Flagship recipes only.**
- **`rust/`** — for categories where Rust genuinely wins (MCP servers, inference runtimes, tool binaries).

## Running a recipe

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheAiSingularity/agentic-ai-cookbook-lab
cd agentic-ai-cookbook-lab/recipes/by-use-case/research-assistant/beginner
make run
```

## Status

This is **Wave 0** — skeleton complete. Wave 1 (3 SOTA recipes + 4 foundations pages + `core/rag/` v0) ships next.

Every recipe ships with:
- `techniques.md` — SOTA techniques used, with primary-source citations
- `eval/` — fixed eval set + reproducible scorer
